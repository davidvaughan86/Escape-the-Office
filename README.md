## Creator's Notes

This is my first program - ever! - 11/01/2020.

Centered around "The Office" this theme based game has my own attempt at witty banter between co-workers as the player attempts to escape the office before running out of health and ultimately working the weekend (boo).

This game is a movement based game.

## The Goal
To create a working menu with working movement commands

## The Player's Goal

Use the corresponding numbers in the in-game legend to guide your direction and try to escape the office. Encountering a coworker will lower your health. 

This game is built on a x and y access plane - negative coordinates are possible. The doors are in the corners (-5,5 - 5,5 - 5,-5 - -5.-5)


## Installation and Play
- $ git clone (repo)
- $ cd (repo)

## Enjoy@
