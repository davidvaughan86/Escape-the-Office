this is my first attempt t a python game - 10/26/2020

this game is a movement based game centered around the office theme.

the goal of this project was to create a working menu with working movement commands

use the numbers to set your direction and try to escape the office. encountering a coworker will lower your health. 

this game is built on a x and y access plane - negative coordinates are possible. The doors are in the corners (-5,5 - 5,5 - 5,-5 - -5.-5)
